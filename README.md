# Deep-Belief-Networks-DBNs-

* Deep Belief Networks represent a sophisticated class of artificial neural networks used in the field of deep learning, a subset of machine learning. 
They are designed to discover and learn complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data, particularly in unsupervised learning tasks.
They are multi-layered networks, where each layer is capable of making sense of the information received from the previous one, gradually building up a complex understanding of the overall data.
DBNs are composed of multiple layers of stochastic, or randomly determined, units. These units are known as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) or other similar structures.
